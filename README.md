# Gomoku
Gomoku is a abstract strategy based game, which is typically played on a Go board. I used to play it a lot with my dad so I 
decided to write a program in C++, which allows to players to play on their laptop. 

## Rules
This game features a 15x15 board. The player using the black stones will go first, and then the white. A winner is found
when a player gets five in a row. This can be vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
